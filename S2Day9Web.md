##### What is Web Application?

```
● A web application is a program or software that runs on a web browser to perform specific
tasks.
● These web applications are made with programming languages like
HTML,CSS,JS,Python(Django,Flask)
● WebSites Consists 2 parts.
○ Front End / Client side /
■ Front End is the Front page/ the page which we access, the graphical part.
■ There are specific Programming languages and Frameworks to build front end of a
website.
● Example: HTML,CSS,JS(react)
■ A person who develop Front end is called “Front End Developer”
○ Back End / Server Side /
■ Back End is another side of a web which users don't have interaction with it, but
their requests will be sent to the server and used to fetch the data from server
and hands to the front page/front end/ of the websites.
■ Also here there are Specific Programming languages
● Example: JS(node.js),Python(Django,Flask),PHP,SQL
■ A person who develop Back end is called “Back End Developer”
● A person who develop Both Front and Back end is called “Full Stack Developer”
```


##### HTML /HyperText Markup language/

● HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
○ Markup language refers to **a text-encoding system consisting of symbols inserted in a text
document to control its structure, formatting, or the relationship between its parts**.
● HTML consists of a series of elements
● HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content

● HTML have elements called Tags.
○ Tags are special words that have < > on their beginning and ending
○ Example: <a> , <html> , <body> , <head> ....
● HTML languages start with a HTML tag
● Those tags have opening and closing tags.
○ <p> ... </p>
■ The text between opening and closing tag is called “innerText”
○ <span> <p> ... </p> </span>
■ The tags inside a tag is called “innerHTML”
● But This doesn't mean all HTML tags need Closing tag.
○ Example: <img> does not have closing tag.


### A Simple HTML Document

● The html tag contains 2 elements
○ Head tag
■ Have elements those does not
appear on the page.
● Title and meta info’s
○ Body tag
■ is a container for all the visible
contents
● headings, paragraphs,
images, hyperlinks,
tables, lists, etc.
● There are header tags
○ <h1>,<h2>,<h3>..<h5>
● Paragraph <p>
● Anchor tags <a> for linking
● Image tags <img>
● Break line(new line) <br>
● Division <div>
○ Used to do container and hold
some tags inside.


##### Web browsers

● The purpose of a web browser (Chrome,
Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML
documents and display them correctly.
● A browser does not display the HTML tags,
but uses them to determine how to display
the document:

##### What is web hacking

● Web hacking refers to exploitation of applications via HTTP which can

```
be done by manipulating the application via its graphical web
interface.
```
● Always Hacking Steps are same on all type of attacks.

```
○ Information gathering
○ Scanning
○ Exploiting
```
● But to hack anything you have to know how the thing works.


##### How do websites work.

###### ● When you access a website or click a link, it will send

###### a HTTP request to the server and get the copy of the

###### website files to the client this is called Response.


##### URL and URI

```
● URI identifies a resource and differentiates it from others by using a name,
location, or both.
● URL identifies the web address or location of a unique resource.
● URI contains components like a scheme, authority, path, and query.
● URL has similar components to a URI, but its authority consists of a domain
name and port.
● A URI aims to identify a resource and differentiate it from other resources by
using the name of the resource or location of the resource.
● A URL aims to find the location or address of a resource on the web.
○ An example of a URI can be ISBN 0-486-35557-4.
○ An example of an URL is https://www.javatpoint.com.
```

##### Parts of URL

A URL consists of five parts:

1. Scheme: tells web servers which protocol to use when it accesses a page on your website.
2. Subdomain:
    a. If your website is like a house, your subdomains are like specific rooms in that house.
    b. A subdomain in a URL indicates which particular page of your website the web browser should
       serve up.
c. For instance, subdomains like “blog” or “offers” will provide your website’s blog page or offers
page.
    d. Subdomains also bucket your website into its main content categories and shows Google and your
       visitors that there's more information on your site than just a homepage.
3. Top-level domain: specifies what type of entity your organization registers as on the internet.
    a. Generic Top level domain(gTLD): .gov .org .net
    b. Country code Top-level domain(ccTLD): .et .ru
4. Second-level domain: is the name of your website.
    5. Subdirectory: also known as a subfolder,helps people understand which particular section of a webpage they’re on.


##### HTTP request and response

```
● As the name suggests HTTP requests are a request which the browser sends
to the server
● HTTP responses are a response from the server to the browser.
● The requests and Response are sent and received with a Header.
```

##### HTTP Headers

● The **HTTP headers** are used to pass information between the clients and the server

```
through the request and response header.
```
● All the headers are case-insensitive, headers fields are separated by colon,

```
key-value pairs in clear-text string format.
```
● The end of the header section denoted by an empty field header(New line).


##### Types of Headers

```
● General Header: This type of headers applied on Request and Response
headers both but with out affecting the database body.
● Request Header: This type of headers contains information about the fetched
request by the client.
● Response Header: This type of headers contains the location of the source that
has been requested by the client.
● Entity Header: This type of headers contains the information about the body of
the resources like Content-length.
```

##### Request Headers

● This is A header sent to the server.

● In Request Header There are different kind of headers

```
○ Example: GET, Host, Cookie,...
```

##### ...

The 1st line Contains

```
● Request Method
● Path: The path where the file/folder is located
● Protocol Type: which HTTP protocol ( HTTP 1 , HTTP/1.1 ,
HTTP/
```
The 2nd line

```
● Host: the website link
```
The 3rd line

```
● Cookie: used to check a user
```
The 4th line

```
● User-Agent: used to place the browser information
```
...


##### Response Header

● This is response from The server to the browser
● 1st line
○ HTTP: Tells the server Protocol
○ Status Code
● 2nd line
○ Date: Date of the response sent
● 3rd line
○ Content-Type: What type of content the server sent
Encode type
● 4th line
○ Content-length: The number of the alphanumeric and
spaces
● 5th line
○ Server: type of the webserver
● 6th line
○ This line is empty used to show that the headers
ending. And begining of the body
● 7th.... Line
○ The html content


##### HTTP request methods

```
● The method designates the type of request being made to the web server.
● The most common types of request methods are GET and POST but there are many others,
including HEAD, PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, and OPTIONS.
● GET and POST are widely supported while support for other methods is sometimes limited but
expanding.
```

##### HTTP Status Code

```
● The Status-Code element in a server response
● is a 3-digit integer where the first digit of the Status-Code defines the class of
response and the last two digits do not have any categorization role.
● There are 5 values for the first digit:
○ 1xx: Informational
■ It means the request has been received and the process is continuing.
○ 2xx: Success
■ It means the action was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
○ 3xx: Redirection
■ It means further action must be taken in order to complete the request.
○ 4xx: Client Error
■ It means the request contains incorrect syntax or cannot be fulfilled.
○ 5xx: Server Error
■ It means the server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.
```

##### Some common codes

● 200 = request is Successful( OK )
● 301 = The requested page has moved to a new url. ( Moved Permanently )
● 302 = The requested page has moved temporarily to a new url .( Found ) => when there is redirection
● 400 = The server did not understand the request. (Bad Request)
● 401 = The requested page needs a username and a password. (Unauthorized)
● 403 = Access is forbidden to the requested page.(Forbidden)
● 404 = The server can not find the requested page.(Not Found)
● 405 = The method specified in the request is not allowed.(Method Not Allowed)
● 500 = The request was not completed. The server met an unexpected condition.(Internal Server Error)


##### Where do you see the headers?

The headers are shown on some methods.

1. Developers tool(on browser)
2. Curl
3. Burp suite


##### Developers tool

● To open it on browser
○ Press Ctrl+shift+C


This tools contains lot of things

1. Inspector:to see and edit the HTML and CSS temporarly
2. Console: to run some Javascript codes
3. Debugger: used to do debug in runtime
4. Network: to see the requests and responses
5. Storage: to store catch and cookies
6. ...

To get the requests we go to the Network tab


##### ...

Click on on of the requests and see
below on the header(drag it up)


#### Curl on linux

● cURL, which stands for client URL, is a command line tool that
developers use to transfer data to and from a server.
● At the most fundamental, cURL lets you talk to a server by
specifying the location (in the form of a URL) and the data you
want to send.
● cURL supports several different protocols, including HTTP and
HTTPS, and runs on almost every platform.
● This makes cURL ideal for testing communication from almost
any device (as long as it has a command line and network
connectivity) from a local server to most edge devices.
● Syntax:
○ curl [options] [URL]


##### ...Options

● To get web content of site

● Change request method

● To see the response headers


##### Burp suite

● Burp or Burp Suite is a set of tools used for penetration testing of web applications.
● It is developed by the company named Portswigger, which is also the alias of its
founder Dafydd Stuttard.

● BurpSuite aims to be an all in one set of tools and its capabilities can be enhanced by
installing add-ons that are called BApps.
● Burp Suite is **an integrated platform and graphical tool for performing security**

**testing of web applications**
● it supports the entire testing process, from initial mapping and analysis of an
application's attack surface, through to finding and exploiting security vulnerabilities.
● It have a lot of tools all together.

● Simply Help Hackers To Act liek A Proxy, it will intercept A request,
○ Used to change it or just watch it


##### Installing

● Burpsuite have 2 versions
○ Community = free
○ Enterprise - paid
○ Professional - paid
● We will install the professional burp.
○ After Downloading it
○ Extract it
○ On the 1st terminal
■ java -javaagent:BurpSuiteLoader_v2022.7.jar -noverify -jar burpsuite_pro_v2022.7.jar
○ On another terminal
■ java -jar Loader.jar

○ ....
● When you Try to open burp next time goto the
folder and execute this command
● java -javaagent:BurpSuiteLoader_v2022.7.jar
-noverify -jar burpsuite_pro_v2022.7.jar


##### ...

● Now Burp will only intercept or see
Requests and reponses from
google.com.


##### 1 step to see interception

● Now, we need to connect
our browser with Burp.
● To Do this we can setup our
proxy setting on our
browser or install a proxy
plugin.

##### OWASP Top 10

● OWASP Stands fro Open Web Application Security Project.

● The OWASP Top 10 is **a standard awareness document for developers and web
application security**.

● It represents about the most critical security risks to web applications.

● Globally recognized by developers as the first step towards more secure coding.
● This Project Realeases Top 10 risky vulns every 4 years.
● Detail: https://owasp.org/Top10/
● OWASP also releases API vulnerabilities


##### ...

● This is the OWASP’s Top 10 Vulns reported in

2021

● Each Vulenrabilitys are Detailed.

● Let us see some Common web Vulnerabilities


##### BruteForce

```
● It is included in Broken Authentication/Access Control Bug
● This is a kind of attack that is usually done to a login pages.
● It uses Wordlist and try to check a lot of words in the place of the username and
password.
● It is a guessing game but the guess is done with computer.
```

##### XSS

● It is included in Injection Bug
● XSS/ Cross site scripting/ is a vulnerability that
leads to a lot of huge attacks.
● This Bug is exploited. As the following
○ If there is a search place and teh search place
expects a text to search and displays below.
○ But if we add some html/JS codes on that place, this
means it will add the code to the innerHTML
○ SO our code will be executed!


##### SQL injection

● It is included in Injection Bug
● It is same with xss, but here we will add a
sql code to the search place.
● SQL is a query language used in Back end
to retrive data from database.
● Most of the time used to byoass login
pages.


##### Rate limit

● This is a limiting problem.
● Think like if the developers did made a limit to
some task.
● Example:
○ If there is website , that send an OTP/verification
code
○ And if it doesnt limit to some code resends only.
○ I can make the site to send 100000 OTPs to ma
phone this means
○ We will make the site to lose a lot of money


##### Access Control

● This is a problem occurd on how a
websites control an access of a user.
● If there is a problem on the access
control.
● Then think that normal user can get
access of admins or root user.
● This is Good Bug to find because u dont
have that much automation tools.


##### IDOR

● IDOR/ **Insecure direct object
references** /: is a bug included in
Access Control.
● This is a bug that happenes when
you have an id number 1
● And is abebe is id 1 then if i changed
that number to 0 and got another
users information


##### Bussiness Logic

● This Bug is a logic Flow.
● It occurs by the way how the programmer
thinks and hackers thinking.
● Think like if You have bank website and it
have a purpose of send money.
● Then if i can change add to negative numbers
● And if the site responde by giveing me more
money and minimizing the amount of the user
i planed to send then this is bussiness logic
● Also this is a Good Bug to learn.

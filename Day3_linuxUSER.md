:arrow_right_hook: using 3 methods
    - And (&&)
    - Or (||)
    - Pipeing (|)

:arrow_right_hook: If both are working without error 
## OR (||)
:arrow_right_hook: On OR operation the command will executed.If it have error or not
## Pipeing(|)
:arrow_right_hook: On pipe,will help you run commands by using the output of the first command as the input for the next one.
